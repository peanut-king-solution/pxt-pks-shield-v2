## Summary
The Micro:bit motor drive expansion board not only enhances motor drive capabilities but also incorporates four motor driven, 2 road, on the basis of stepper motor driver, 
also raises the additional 8 road steering gear interface, IO port, 2 road 9 I2C interface.
In addition, it provides an extra eight steering gear interfaces, IO ports, and two 9 I2C interfaces.
The motor uses a high-current interface, while the steering machine, I2C, and IO ports all use the Gravity standard interface, supporting a vast number of modules and sensors. 
The expansion board is powered by a voltage range of 3.5v to 5.5v and offers two power interface modes: a 3.5mm plug and wiring. 
It's known for its wide voltage compatibility, numerous ports, compact size, and plug-and-play convenience.

```JavaScript
basic.forever(function () {
    pksdriver.MotorRun(pksdriver.Motors.M1, pksdriver.Dir.CCW, 80) // set the speed of moter M1
    pksdriver.MotorRun(pksdriver.Motors.M2, pksdriver.Dir.CW, 80)
    basic.pause(1500)
    pksdriver.motorStopAll() // stop all the motors
})
